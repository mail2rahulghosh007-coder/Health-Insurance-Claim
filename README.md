#  Health Insurance Claim Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Health Insurance Claim Prediction model** to estimate insurance claim amounts based on customer attributes. The solution follows a complete machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis to model comparison and performance evaluation.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
- Analyzed **feature correlations** and investigated how different customer attributes influence insurance claim amounts.
- Used visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and relationships among variables.

---

##  Data Preprocessing
- Applied **Label Encoding** to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- Used **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features and improve model performance.
- Prepared a clean and consistent dataset suitable for regression modeling.

---

##  Machine Learning Models Implemented
The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

- Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

Reusable Python logic was implemented to streamline model training and evaluation, making the workflow easily adaptable for future projects.

##  Model Performance
- Among all models tested, **XGBoost Regressor** delivered the best results.
- Achieved an **R² score of 82.62%**, indicating strong predictive performance.
